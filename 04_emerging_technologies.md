# Generative AI (Large Language Models)

## Purpose
The main purpose of Generative AI—especially Large Language Models (LLMs)—is to **automate and enhance knowledge work**, enabling machines to generate human-like text, assist with creative tasks, and support decision-making. It aims to increase efficiency, personalization, and innovation across both education and IT sectors.

## Usage

- **In Education**:  
  Generative AI is used as **AI tutors and teaching assistants**, offering step-by-step guidance (instead of giving answers), aiding teachers in generating lesson plans, quizzes, rubrics, and more.  
  Example: **Khan Academy’s “Khanmigo”**, built on GPT-4, helps students with subjects like math and writing, and assists teachers with class prep and feedback.

- **In IT**:  
  Generative AI powers **developer copilots** that suggest code snippets, write documentation, and help debug, as well as **IT service management assistants** that summarize tickets and generate automation scripts.  
  Example tools: **GitHub Copilot** and **ServiceNow Now Assist** (not directly linked here, but widely documented tools in IT).

## Examples

- **In Education**:  
  **Khan Academy (K–12 / Teachers)** launched **Khanmigo**, an AI-powered assistant (GPT-4–based tutor) that supports students and aids educator workflows; in August 2024 they released **Khanmigo for Teachers** with **free tools** for educators in partnership with Microsoft.

    _Source: Wikipedia (Khan Academy entry, May 2025), details on Khanmigo, its launch and ‘for Teachers’ initiative._ (same link as above)

- **In IT**:  
  Although not directly linked here, **GitHub Copilot** has been shown in studies to allow developers to complete coding tasks significantly faster (e.g., ~56% faster)—this aligns with McKinsey’s finding that software engineering is a high-impact use case.  
  - **Reference**:  
    _Source: McKinsey report (same as above) highlighting that software engineering is among the top four functions (customer operations, marketing/sales, software engineering, R&D) where generative AI delivers ~75% of its value._
