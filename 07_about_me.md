## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because it will really help me improve my portfolio. Since this GitHub account was created to showcase our commitment to projects, I see it as a good way to track and present the work we’ve done. As an aspiring Project Manager, I believe it’s important to understand how version control works and how collaboration tools like GitHub can keep projects organized and transparent. I don’t just want to show finished outputs. I also want to highlight the process, the progress, and the dedication behind each project.
